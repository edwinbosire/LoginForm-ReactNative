# LoginForm 

An experiment to recreate a login form for TheWeek.com using React-Native. I am currently in the process of learning React-Native and working through online examples.

In this example we are using the following React-Native Components:
* KeyboardAvoidingView
* Text
* Image
* View
* TextInput
* TouchableOpacity

The video I followed for this can be found [on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUdy4PHIbww&)
